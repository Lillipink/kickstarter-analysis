# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
An analysis regarding different kickstarters from all over the world was completed to provide insight on the specifics of the probability of having a successful theater campaign in the U.S.
## **Probability Of a Successful Theater Campaign**
Beginning a Kickstarter campaign in the month of May would prove to be the best probability unlike January, March and Spetember, which all had the worst fail rate throughout many years. This analysis also provided much insight to which categorical campaigns seem to be more successful than others. Data below will display how "theater" happens to be the most prosperous amongst all other categories within the U.S. This dataset displayed how a high "goal" atributed to having a lower success rate and fewer pledged than a "low" goal amount. In the data set under "Descriptive Statistics," the campaigns with much higher goals were pledged the least amount due to the high ambitions rather than the lower set goals which were most successful. Setting a low goal will make the probabilities of a rewarding campaign much higher as well as beginning a campaign in the month of May. Along with low goals, another country that suggests to have a high likelihood of supporting theatrical plays is G.B. as thearter was also amongst the highest successes for Kickstarter. This is a benefit as G.B. is a country that has already been considered for starting this new kickstarter campaign, in case of the plausibility of the U.S. being lower in theater campaigns.
